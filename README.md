# London's Accessibilility Analysis
This social atlas seeks to investigate if there is a spatial pattern between sustainable transport usage and accessibility to sustainable transport facilities in London. First, it analyses the spatial autocorrelation of sustainable transport usage in London. Subsequently, it zooms into two case study boroughs (hotspot and coldspot) to examine the possible relationship between high sustainable transport usage with public transport accessibility and last mile travel amenities. Techniques used include Getis-Ord spatial correlation, buffering, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN).

From a macro perspective, the atlas aims to the suggest improving access to sustainable transport facilities (public transport routes, bike lanes and stands) to encourage more sustainable travel behaviours throughout London, thereby reducing reliance on cars and promoting a greener future.

All data is calibrated at LSOA Super Output Area (LSOA) for a detailed spatial visualization. The atlas uses the percentage of people travelling to work by sustainable modes of travel (SMOT), including public transport, cycling or walking to showcase sustainable transport usage.
